# Instructions

In this exercise, you will create an HTML page for your own portfolio website.
Your page will need to include the following elements:
1. A centered header
2. An image
3. An about me section with a header and a paragraph

Example: Open the index.html file in the solution folder in your browser to see an example. Try not to look at the solution code :)

Bonus:
1. Center the image horizontally
2. Add colours to parts of the paragraph by using the `span` element.
